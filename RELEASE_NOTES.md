# Release notes

## v0.4.4-controlled-preview-rc — council, legal and handoff hardening

- Added an Ed25519 integrity-bound scanner-attestation contract with exact object-version/hash/size binding, freshness, nonce, engine/policy identity and short-read rejection.
- Added founder-council pre-mortem, India legal/political gates and a 48-hour controlled-preview plan.
- Added deterministic Gumloop system/chat prompts and no-force-push/no-deploy integration rules.
- Public uploads and real-case publication remain blocked; AWS and counsel receipts are still required.

## v0.4.3-controlled-beta-rc — AWS boundary and release hardening

- Added an executable ALB/Cognito ES256 gateway with signer, client, issuer, subject, expiry and duplicate-header checks.
- Added frozen 30-second v1 gateway assertions and server-side exact role binding.
- Added AWS task-role/default-chain S3 verification with exact object-version binding.
- Added separate gateway and app ECS services, task roles, ENIs and security groups.
- Added a plan-only OpenTofu stack for ALB, Cognito TOTP, ECS, RDS, four custody buckets, WAF, monitoring and budgets.
- Replaced arbitrary-command/tag deployment paths with exact Git SHA, required-check and image-digest gates.
- Added machine-verifiable same-SHA/same-digest AWS target receipt gates.
- This remains a release candidate until real AWS staging and production receipts pass.

## v0.4.1-synthetic-preview — controlled synthetic technical preview packaging

- Added launch positioning, known limitations, go/no-go, and founders-council verdict.
- Added legal disclaimer and privacy/takedown drafts (unsigned).
- Added stakeholder reaction matrix and kill-switch runbook.
- Added traction metric definitions without fabricated counts.
- Added Gumloop/AWS next steps and 90-day roadmap.
- Added `scripts/external_evaluator.py` and synthetic evaluator fixtures.
- Aligned README/status language to **controlled synthetic technical preview**.
- Did **not** fabricate production-environment receipts or design-partner claims.

## v0.4.1 — production-consistency and PostgreSQL path hardening

- Aligned package/runtime/SBOM version strings to **0.4.1**.
- Clarified that `scripts/migrate_legacy.py` and `scripts/migrate_v2_to_v3.py` are **SQLite-only** and refuse `DATABASE_URL`.
- Hardened `scripts/recovery.py` / `scripts/recovery_evidence.py` / `scripts/verify_audit.py` for dual SQLite + PostgreSQL backends via the shared abstraction.
- Replaced remaining `sqlite_master` checks in server init with `table_exists()`.
- Added a CI PostgreSQL service-container job that applies `db/schema_postgres.sql` and runs live abstraction smoke checks.
- Documented external production blockers honestly; no fabricated staging/OIDC/storage evidence.


## v0.4.0 — public projection and abuse-control hardening

- Added an explicit allowlisted public dossier projection so anonymous reads cannot leak reviewer-only or quarantine/internal fields.
- Added regression tests that prove public bundles exclude raw source/document tables and internal claim metadata.
- Replaced the single in-memory write limiter with route-aware public/auth/write/expensive-write quotas.
- Added optional proxy-aware client identification via `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=1` for trusted reverse-proxy deployments.
- Expanded Prometheus metrics for rate-limit, idempotency replay/conflict, and quarantine-block visibility.
- Updated the security workflow to use the MIT-licensed gitleaks CLI directly instead of the licensed GitHub action.
- Automated verification now covers 26 tests, browser acceptance, smoke path, release checks, and repeat loop runs.
- Added downloadable evidence capsules plus `scripts/verify_capsule.py` for offline public-verification flows.
- Added `scripts/preflight_prod_env.py` and `scripts/rehearse_production.py` for provider-neutral production-mode rehearsal with signed OIDC, managed-storage, monitoring, capsule, and recovery receipts.

## v0.3.0 — transactional production hardening

- Serialized review/correction/publication transitions with claim-version binding and concurrency tests.
- Credential expiry, revocation and atomic rotation; production bearer tokens disabled.
- Fresh MFA-marked, HMAC-authenticated OIDC gateway assertions.
- Production idempotency-key requirement and replay/conflict handling.
- Externally keyed per-event audit checkpoints and fork/tamper detection.
- Quarantine blocks publication until a separate scanner role records a clean result.
- Atomic v2→v3 migration plus authenticated pre-migration backups.
- Authenticated backup manifests, audit-aware clean restore and signed RPO/RTO evidence.
- Signed S3-compatible object verification and authenticated monitoring webhooks.
- 23 automated tests plus restart/restore smoke verification.

## v0.2.0 — hardened public beta (14 July 2026)

### Added
- Provenance-first sources, documents, reviews and revision history.
- Two-person independent approval gate and fresh review after corrections.
- Public/private data separation and candidate-claim suppression.
- Hash-chained immutable audit trail with offline verifier.
- Request IDs, structured logs, rate/body limits and strict security headers.
- Online SQLite backup, clean restore verification and restart/restore E2E smoke test.
- Safety-preserving legacy migration with automatic pre-v2 backup.
- Reproducible source release, CycloneDX SBOM, checksums and build provenance.

### Security behavior
- Claims cannot be created directly as reviewed or published.
- Admin credentials cannot act as reviewer credentials.
- Public endpoints expose only published projects and public claim states.
- Uploaded-document metadata begins in quarantine/pending-scan state; no malware-scan claim is fabricated.

### Honest limitations
This is a public-beta reference, not a v1 production certification. Managed database/object storage, OIDC/MFA, HTTPS/WAF, monitoring/on-call, legal/privacy approval, real two-person launch-case review and target-environment recovery/load evidence must be supplied by the operator. See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md`.
