## Honest scope

Project X-Ray helps humans assemble **source-linked dossiers**, record missing evidence, run **two-person review**, and export review/RTI material.

It does **not**:

- determine corruption, guilt, intent, legality, or fitness for office;
- move public funds or replace PFMS/GeM/PAIMANA;
- treat news reports as proof;
- authorize real-case publication merely because the software runs.

## Monday 20 July 2026 launch mode

**GO: controlled synthetic technical preview** for invited evaluators.

- Synthetic data only
- No real-person/project allegations
- No traction/impact claims
- Kill switch required before any hosted surface

## What works in this package

- Create and list projects
- Source-linked candidate claims with explicit evidence states
- Two distinct reviewers before publication and after corrections
- Document metadata with SHA-256 and quarantine state
- Missing-document gaps and authority responses
- Evidence report and draft RTI output
- SQLite local path and PostgreSQL schema/runtime path
- JSON API and public dashboard
- Race-safe review/publish transitions
- Production-oriented OIDC gateway assertion verification paths
- Fail-closed quarantine with separate scanner role
- Audit checkpoints, backup/restore tooling, capsule export/verify
- Unit tests, browser acceptance, smoke and release checks

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Optional PostgreSQL: set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
# and apply db/schema_postgresqls.sql before first start.
python3 app/server.py
# open http://localhost:8080
```

Run verification:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/check_release.py
python3 scripts/smoke_e2e.py
python3 scripts/rehearse_production.py
python3 scripts/external_evaluator.py
python3 scripts/verify_capsule.py capsule.json
```

Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Production and deployment

Do not label a deployment production-ready merely because it boots. Target gates live in:

- `docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`
- `docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `ops/production-readiness.yaml`
- `docs/roadmap/GUMLOOP_AWS_NEXT_STEPS.md`

## No-fake-claims rule

- Synthetic records must display `SYNTHETIC` promisently.
- “Not found” means “not located in searched sources,” never “does not exist.”
- An official statement is an official claim, not independent verification.
- A risk indicator is a review prompt, not evidence of corruption.
- No real case may be public until two-person source review and operator legal/editorial gates pass.
